# Pinterest Clone

This project is just a fun way to test my skills by recreating the styling (and hopefully function) of Pinterest's website.

## Languages

- HTML
- CSS

## Goals

I want to complete this project without using outside styling libraries or frameworks-- for example without Bootstrap.

## Todo

- Modals from the navbar
- User input to add a Pin

### Icebox

- Node.js backend
